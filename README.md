## 📁 Repository Hygiene

This repo includes standardized `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes` files to ensure clean commits and cross-platform consistency:

- `.gitignore`: excludes executables, object files, logs, Python cache, editor folders, and temp files.
- `.gitattributes`: enforces LF line endings for C, Python, and shell scripts; normalizes text handling across platforms.

> 💡 These files are also used to teach best practices in Git version control and are auto-suggested by **GitHub Copilot** during setup.
